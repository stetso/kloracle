  <h1>Kloracle</h1>
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
  The kloracle is a small software project by stetso. 
  It was inspired by the fact that there is a considerable lack of knowledge about the
  future. The kloracle was invented to mitigate this problem. Forunately all predicitions
  are given in the form of emojis, the type of communication with the highest density of 
  information currently known to humanity.
  </p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
  Concentrate on your most pressing question about your unknown future and touch or click
  the glass ball. Keep touching so the kloracle can work its wonders and present the answer.
  The prediction works much better if you are around friends and tell your question beforehand.
