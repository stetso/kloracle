# Kloracle website

This is the source code for the Kloracle website which allows insanely detailed predictions of the future.

If you would like to hack around, simply clone the repository and install dependencies (currently only one - Parcel) with `npm install` (you will need NodeJS and NPM installed on your system). Start developing with `npm run dev`. That is it.
